        <article>
          <p>Before you get to lay down whatever you want to write in your webpage, you need to start at the top. This is going to be hard to imagine since you don't actually see the top. However, your electronics devices and softwares can see it and you need to tell them too what you're doing so that they can display it for you and know how you should be searched.</p>
          <p>First, you have to start with declaration <code>!DOCTYPE html</code>. It is simply to say that your website is written using HTML (it's always HTML), version 5, to be specific.</p>
          <p>The next one is <code>html</code> tag. This is to add the base of everything you're about to write. It is also a good thing to add attribute (i.e. the traits of your element, which is the thing in <>) <code>lang</code> to tell your computer what language you like to use for display. 
          <p>Now to the head. The <code>head</code> lives inside the html (as well as anything else except the declaration). It includes the information your computer want to about display and metadata, like who write this thing or which character set to use (it's always UTF-8). Here's the example of what you can put:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>meta charset="utf-8"</code>: for character set computer use for display</li>
            <li><code>meta name="description"</code>: tell search engines what you web is about. Explain yourself in <code>content</code> attribute.</li>
            <li><code>meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</code>: to make your web adjust to the size of the screen.</li>
            <li><code>title</code>: the name of your web, for the search engines to catagorize.</li>
            <li><code>link rel="stylesheet"</code>: in case you want to add decorations from other codes (which you should). Use <code>href</code> attribute to tell which file you program should take.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_navigator">
        <header>The Navigator</header>
        <article>
          <p>Navigator is basically the tab that gives you the way to jump to other pages in the website. There are, in fact, many types of navigator and most websites will use a lot of them at once for different levels of where to jump (jumping between main pages use a horizontal tab bar, jumping between subpage use vertical tab bar, and a small link to show you where you've come from, etc.). The navigator is indicated using <code>nav</code> tag and written using the power of bullet point list (<code>ul</code> and inserted <code>li</code> inside), anchor (<code>a</code>), and decorations. As an example you can click on 'web developer' tool in your browser and check the code of the navigation bar on your left to see how it works.</p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="the_body"-->
        <header>The Body</header>
        <article>
          <p>The body is, of course, where your information goes. To mark the body section (as opposed to the metadata in <code>head</code>), you can use <code>body</code> tag to do so. Inside of the body, you can also seperate things into <code>section</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>article</code> (for self-contained texts), and so on to make the parts clearer.</p>
        <p>Besides the layout, you will also need to give your text the basic format. You can use the <code>p</code> for paragraghs, <code>h</code> for titles (the <code>h</code> has six level of importance from <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> to seperate main section from subsection from sub-subsection from sub-sub-subsection...). You can also do things like making text <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, or <del>strikethrough</del> as well.</p>
        <p>But what if the thing you write isn't a paragraph? In that case, use other layout elements, there are many to choose from, such as <code>table</code> for tables, <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> for photos and photo descriptions. Of course there's a lot more for you to utilize so try to look at what best for you.</p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="extra_sprinkles">
        <header>Extra Sprinkles</header>
        <article>
          <p>Because we're in the computer era, the text can do more than just sit there for you to read. Here's some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>a</code>: for linking to other website or page</li>
            <li><code>img</code>: for adding image. Don't forget to add your source with <code>src</code> attibute, and if you would be so kind to screenreaders, add <code>alt</code> attribute to explain the picture too.</li>
            <li><code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> with <code>li</code>: respectively, they are for bullet list, number list, and items on the list.</li>
            <li><code>form</code>: for making forms in your website. There's a lot more details inside such as which type of input you like and where to send, which I unfortunately don't have time for that, so follow up later maybe.</li>
            <li><code>div</code>: to add shapes and forms to your website. It is very helpful when you decorate it with the text inside.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="goodbye">
        <header>Goodbye</header>
        <p>That's it mate. All for now. Call for me later if you want additional information. I will be death for quite a while.</p>
